# Swopp
Share free deals with everyone

## What's Swopp
Swopp is an open-source project being developed 'three happy friends' for everyone to get in touch with free stuff around the globe. ICOs, software, games, services, etc.. Anything goes free goes into our list.

## Entry Point
We have just realized that you can't keep a track on everything you love (and potentially be loved). You wouldn't want to miss a chance to go to a concert of one of your favourite bands WHEN YOU KNEW IT. And for the sake of the information, you need to follow a lot of sources to get it.

## Solution
Swopp is the key to this confusion. Instead of following too many sources, keeping tracks and begging for knowledge; you can just use Swopp. It will understand your needs and notify you when an opportunity is available.

## Behind the veil
Swopp's goal is not only listing FREE DEALS for FREE, but also expanding your favourites basket with relational stuff. You know, everything is connected SOMEHOW and we want to connect the DOTS.

# Technical Information
Swopp is planned to be hosted on NodeJS with MongoDB database. We'll be mostly using ReactJS during the development. The website will be able to be viewed by any kind of device and browser.

## Road Map
* Designate core needs and the database
* Prepare backend server
* Draw UI (on paper)
* Learn ML for the automated bot
* Create tests
